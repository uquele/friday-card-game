Wrong gameplay mechanics

- keep destroyed cards on the table
- pirates +1 power works incorrectly. It should just count +1 power per card, not adding it to card itself. This should also include destroyed cards

- 

- add destroyed deck
- add ability to see cards in discard and destroyed piles
- add ability to choose a card you want to exchange with, rather than choosing a random one (make sure to allow to cancel exchange from the beginning and not consume it)


Convenience

- add red color to Give up button
- create a button to draw cards from fighting deck

Additions

- allow for vertical layout and larger fonts for mobile
- reduce size of closed decks, open cards need more space

- reduce amounts of rerendering by changing values rather than adding html blocks
- add animations

- add ability for other players to see how you play
- add ability to play with them together as if they were sitting together

Possible bugs

- game showed a hazard card instead of 2 pirate cards on phase change. Happened only once on firefox mobile
- there might be a bug with Double effect. It seems that the power difference is affected too much with this card is used
