Wrong gameplay mechanics

- Depleting the fighting cards at pirates should lead to death, not to taking aging cards
- keep destroyed cards on the table
- pirates +1 power works incorrectly. It should just count +1 power per card, not adding it to card itself. This should also include destroyed cards

- add destroyed deck
- add ability to see cards in discard and destroyed piles
- add ability to choose a card you want to exchange with, rather than choosing a random one (make sure to allow to cancel exchange from the beginning and not consume it)

Bugs

- when putting under pile it's not clear that you are putting a 'Copy' card with used ability -> add blue color
- allow to cancel double action and not use it if cancelled

Rework

- should add fighting state to fight
- redo css to make it simplier: classes for colored buttons, less copy-pasting

Convenience

- add red color to Give up button
- create a button to draw cards from fighting deck
- indicate somehow that the ability is not possible to use -> grey out?

Additions

- allow for vertical layout and larger fonts for mobile
- reduce size of closed decks, open cards need more space

- reduce amounts of rerendering by changing values rather than adding html blocks
- add animations

- add ability for other players to see how you play
- add ability to play with them together as if they were sitting together

Possible bugs

- there might be a bug with Double effect. It seems that the power difference is affected too much when this card is used
